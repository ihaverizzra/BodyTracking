I have 4 files based on OCR Body tracking, Track the real bones in your bones in your body in RLT (Real Life Time)

On hand.py it shows the bones in your hand multiple peoples hands can be in the video

entireBODY.py is OCR body tracing so it traces your body (Please note this file is still under development so it will be buggy)

handxmouse.py is a OCRxComputerMouse you can now use just your hand to control your enitre computer, crunch up your hands in a fist to left click (still working on right click Thank you!)

Last LockMouse.py 
It lists all the applacations running on your computer at the time (Please note if there is over 300 aplacations running dont be alarmed (Windows background files are running in the background to keep your computer stable)
you can search for a certain applaction on your computer and you can monitor it for Bodys or any 3d model you would like.

There is a better version being worked on right now and is set to release soon
Thank you for your patience!
